               <li>By default, the IDE offers to put your workspace in <var class="varname">home_directory</var><span class="filepath">/ide-4.7-workspace</span> on Linux, and <span class="filepath">C:\ide-4.7-workspace</span> on Windows (whereas in 6.4.1 it was <span class="filepath">ide-4.6-workspace</span>, in 6.4.0 it was <span class="filepath">ide-4.5-workspace</span>, in 6.3.2 it was <span class="filepath">ide-4-workspace</span>, and earlier the default was <span class="filepath">workspace</span>), so now there's less chance of accidentally migrating your old workspace. 
               </li>
               <li>When you import existing projects, you now have the option of making a <em>copy</em> of it in your workspace. This is preferable because it leaves the original untouched as a backup. See <a href="wizards_importing_.html" shape="rect">Importing projects</a> in the Project and Wizard Properties Reference chapter.

               Development Platform version 6.4.1. Although the conversion process attempts to maintain configuration options, you should
               verify your individual project files to make sure any new settings have been initialized to the values you want.
