      <h1 class="topictitle1">How the coverage tool works</h1>
      
      
      
      <div>
         <p></p>
         
         
         <p>
            The IDE's code coverage tool works in conjunction with the compiler (<span class="cmdname">gcc</span>), the QNX C library (<span class="filepath">libc</span>), and optionally the remote target agent (<span class="cmdname">qconn</span>). When code coverage is enabled for an application, the compiler instruments the code so that at run time, each branch execution
            to a basic block is counted. During the build, the IDE produces data files in order to recreate the program's flow graph and
            to provide line locations of each block. 
         </p>
         
         
         <div class="cautiontitle">CAUTION:</div>
         <div class="caution">Since the IDE creates secondary data files at compilation time, you must be careful when building your programs in a multitargeted
            build environment, such as QNX Neutrino. 
            <p>You must either: </p>
            <br clear="none" /><ul>
               <li>ensure that the last compiled binary is the one you're collecting coverage data on, 
                  <p>or: </p>
                  
               </li>
               <li>enable only <em>one</em> architecture and one variant (debug or release).
               </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Note also that the compiler's optimizations could produce unexpected results, so you should perform coverage tests on an unoptimized,
               debug-enabled build.
            </p>
            
         </div>
         
         
         <p> When you build an application with the <span class="uicontrol">Build with Code Coverage</span> build option enabled and then launch it using a <span class="uicontrol">C/C++ QNX Qconn (IP)</span> launch configuration, the instrumented code linked into the process connects to <span class="cmdname">qconn</span>, allowing the coverage data to be read from the process's data space. However, if you launch a coverage-built process with
            coverage <em>disabled</em> in the launch configuration, this causes the process to write the coverage information to a data file (<span class="filepath">.gcda</span>) at run time, rather than read it from the process's data space. Later, you can import the data into the IDE code coverage
            tool. For information about importing <span class="cmdname">gcc</span> coverage data from a project, see <a href="coverage_IMPGCCCODE_.html" shape="rect">Importing gcc code coverage data from a project</a> later in this chapter.
         </p>
         
         
         <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> If you want to instrument a static library with code coverage, you must also instrument your binary with code coverage, or
            link with the code coverage library using the following option in the linker command: <pre class="codeblock" xml:space="preserve">-lgcov</pre>
            <p>This option will link in the ${<span class="envar">QNX_HOST</span>}<span class="filepath">/usr/lib/gcc/<var class="varname">target</var>/<var class="varname">version</var>/libcov.a</span> library. 
            </p>
            
         </div>
         
         
         <p>Once a coverage session has begun, you can immediately view the data. The QNX Code Coverage perspective contains a Code Coverage
            Sessions view that lists previous as well as currently active sessions. You can explore each session and browse the corresponding
            source files that have received coverage data. 
         </p>
         
         
         <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Code Coverage might not work as expected because the code coverage data for C++ projects includes other functions that are
            also in the source file, such as static initializer and global constructor functions. In addition, the files included by <tt>include</tt> statements aren't included in the overall coverage total; only those functions that are in the original source are included
            for code coverage.
