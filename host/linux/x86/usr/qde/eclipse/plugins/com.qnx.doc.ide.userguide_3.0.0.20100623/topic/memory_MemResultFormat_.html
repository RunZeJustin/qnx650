         <p>In the IDE, you can import trace data session information from a Memory
            Analysis session view. When importing memory analysis session
            information, the IDE lets you import the event-specific results for
            <tt>libmalloc</tt> events in <span class="filepath">.csv</span>
            format, and the other session trace data in <span class="filepath">.xml</span>
            format.
