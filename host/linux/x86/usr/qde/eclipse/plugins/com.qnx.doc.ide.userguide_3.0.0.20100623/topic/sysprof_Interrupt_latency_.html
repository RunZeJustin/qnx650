      <div>
         <p></p>
         
         
         <p>There are several different types of interrupt latency that you can measure in a system:
            
         </p>
         
         <br clear="none" /><ul>
            <li>the time from the HW signal generation to the start of software processing </li>
            <li>the time it takes before a non-OS control function can be invoked in response to the interrupt </li>
            <li>the time it takes for a user thread to be activated in response to this type of external event </li>
         </ul>
         
         
         <p>The System Profiler, as a type of software logic analyzer, helps you look at the timing of activities once the interrupt has
            been acknowledged by the operating system. In order to accurately measure the time between the signal generation and the acknowledgment
            of it, you need additional hardware tools. 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong>Requirements</strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>To measure interrupt service time (the time taken for the operating system to acknowledge the interrupt, handle it, and return
            to normal processing), you must log the Neutrino Interrupt Entry/Exit events. 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>If you're interested in the time from the operating system's acknowledgment to a service handling routine, then you also need
            to capture the Interrupt Handler Entry/Exit events in the log file. 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>To properly gauge the latency in triggering a response in user code, you should also log the Neutrino thread READY and RUNNING
            states, in addition to the communication PULSE events, since these are often used to trigger a user application's behavior
            in response to an interrupt. 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong>Procedure</strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Interrupt activity is best viewed in the System Profiler editor using the Timeline editor pane. Open the target log file in
            the System Profiler editor. Switch to the Timeline editor pane via the menu item <span class="menucascade">
               <span class="uicontrol">System Profiler</span>
               &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Display</span>
               &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Switch Pane</span>
               &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Timeline</span>
               </span>.
            
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>You should see a display that resembles the following. The details will of course be different, but the layout similar: </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <span><img src="../images/2Fsysprof_Interrupt_latency_.xml_d176744e94.jpg" alt="System Profiler: Timeline editor" /></span>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>This display shows the various event owners/sources (interrupts, interrupt handlers, processes and threads) as a tree with
            their associated events arranged horizontally as a timeline. 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>If you've logged Interrupt Handler Entry/Exit events, then you should be able to expand the interrupt entries to show the
            various handlers (more than one handler can be attached to service an interrupt source), such as the following: 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <span><img src="../images/2Fsysprof_Interrupt_latency_.xml_d176744e110.jpg" alt="System Profiler: interrupt handlers" /></span>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Here you can see that the <tt>io-pkt</tt> process has attached to <cite>Interrupt 0x8c</cite> and that <span class="cmdname">proncto</span> has attached to <cite>Interrupt 0x800000000</cite>, which on this system is the timer interrupt firing once every millisecond or so. 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>You can determine how many interrupt events are occurring in this log file by using the General Statistics view. This view
            is part of the default System Profiler perspective, and you can also access it via <span class="menucascade">
               <span class="uicontrol">Window</span>
               &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Show View</span>
               &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Other…</span>
               &gt; <span class="uicontrol">General Statistics</span>
               </span>. 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <span><img src="../images/2Fsysprof_Interrupt_latency_.xml_d176744e152.jpg" alt="System Profiler: Refresh statistics" /></span>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>If you use the refresh button, this view extracts the event statistics for the entire log file (default), or for only a selected
            area if specified. This results in the following display: 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <span><img src="../images/2Fsysprof_Interrupt_latency_.xml_d176744e165.jpg" alt="System Profiler: entire log file" /></span>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>This table provides a breakdown for all of the event sources, showing the number of raw events and also the maximum, minimum,
            average, and total duration of the various Neutrino thread states in this log file. 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>If you're interested in only the events associated with the timer interrupt (<cite>Interrupt 0x80000000</cite>), you can select that event owner in the Timeline editor pane: 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <span><img src="../images/2Fsysprof_Interrupt_latency_.xml_d176744e183.jpg" alt="System Profiler: timer interrupt" /></span>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Next, uncheck the <span class="uicontrol">Show statistics for all elements</span> check box at the bottom of the General Statistics view: 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The General Statistics view tables will show the content limited to just the selected event owners. </p>
         
         
         <p>Using this technique, you can get an estimate of the rough order of magnitude of how many events you're looking at in a log
            file, and in the case of interrupts, you can see some of the statistics about what the maximum, minimum, average, and total
            times spent were. 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>This display also lets you drill down further into the results, by allowing navigation in the Timeline editor pane directly
            to the maximum and minimum times, where you can look at the exact timing sequences. To do this, select one of the entries
            in the States table, and then right-click or use the toolbar to jump to the appropriate selection. 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>In order to look at the timing sequence of an interrupt, you usually have to zoom in on the timeline a significant amount
            to achieve an adequate level of visual detail, since interrupt processing is typically fast compared to the length of the
            log files. If you zoom into an area where a networking interrupt is being processed, the Timeline editor pane will change
            to look something like: 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <span><img src="../images/2Fsysprof_Interrupt_latency_.xml_d176744e211.jpg" alt="System Profiler: interrupt details" /></span>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>At this level of granularity, it also helps to see the trace event log concurrently with the Timeline editor pane. This is
            part of the standard System Profiler perspective, and you can access it using <span class="menucascade">
               <span class="uicontrol">Window</span>
               &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Show View</span>
               &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Other…</span>
               &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Trace Event Log</span>
               </span>. The Trace Event Log and the Timeline editor pane are synchronized; when you change your cursor in the editor, the selection
            in the Trace Event Log view also changes. 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <span><img src="../images/2Fsysprof_Interrupt_latency_.xml_d176744e239.jpg" alt="System Profiler: synchronizing" /></span>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The selection synchronization is shown here. In the Trace Event Log view, we've selected the <cite>Interrupt 0x8c</cite> Entry event through to the <cite>Interrupt 0x8c</cite> Exit event. This represents the start to end of the processing of the interrupt event. In the timeline display, this selection
            is made and the timing measurement of 11.304 microseconds is displayed: 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <span><img src="../images/2Fsysprof_Interrupt_latency_.xml_d176744e257.jpg" alt="System Profiler: timing measurement" /></span>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>So the total interrupt handling time from start to end of the operating system interrupt service routine, including the event
            handler was 11.304 microseconds. If you want to just look at the handling time for interrupt handler attached by the <tt>io-pkt</tt> process, you can see that this time is only 8 microseconds. These times represent the earliest and latest points in time
            that can be measured before entering/exiting control of the software. 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>You can also see in this example that the <tt>io-pkt</tt> interrupt handler is returning a pulse that's triggering something in the user's application (event 13515) and that an <tt>io-pkt</tt> thread is then scheduled to service that request. You can also measure this latency to determine how long it takes to go
            from operating system awareness of the interrupt to eventual application processing, using the same selection technique: 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <span><img src="../images/2Fsysprof_Interrupt_latency_.xml_d176744e281.jpg" alt="System Profiler: interrupt latency" /></span>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>There are many different choices in terms of what time ranges are of interest to measure. Here we've decided to measure from
            the time that the operating system is aware of the interrupt (event 13511) through to the point at which the user process
            has started to respond to the signal generated by the <tt>io-pkt</tt> interrupt handler. Since the interrupt handler communicates using a pulse (event 13515), then the earliest that the user
            code can respond is when the <tt>MsgReceive()</tt> kernel call exits (event 13519) with the received pulse. In this case, we can see that the end-to-end latency from OS awareness
            to the start of user processing (nonprivileged) is 46.304 microseconds: 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <span><img src="../images/2Fsysprof_Interrupt_latency_.xml_d176744e300.jpg" alt="System Profiler: timing measurement" /></span>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Alternate measurements that could be of interest and that you can easily examine include: </p>
         
         <br clear="none" /><ul>
            <li>The time that it takes for the user process to be scheduled rather than the time for it to start processing. This would be
               signified by a transition of one of the receiving process's (<tt>io-pkt</tt>) threads to a READY or RUNNING state (event 13516 for example). This time may be significantly different from the actual
               start of processing time in busy systems with execution taking place with mixed priorities. 
            </li>
            <li>The time between the end of specific interrupt handler processing, and the awareness of the user process (either the scheduling
               or the start of processing) of the interrupt's occurrence. This timing can be quite relevant when there are multiple interrupt-handling
               routines sharing the interrupt that may skew the time before the interrupt handler starts its processing of the interrupt.
               
            </li>
         </ul>
