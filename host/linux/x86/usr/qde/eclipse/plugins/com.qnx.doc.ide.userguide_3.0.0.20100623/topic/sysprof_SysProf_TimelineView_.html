         <p>The timeline provides a detailed view of elements in the trace, and its related states and events, as shown below.</p>
         
         
         <p>
            <span><img src="../images/sprof_SysProf_TimelineView_.xml_d177821e17.jpg" alt="System Profiler Timeline view" /></span>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <div class="fignone">
            
            <p>The System Profiler's Timeline view.</p>
            
            
         </div>
         
         
         <p>The Timeline also serves to populate many of the other views and panes within System Profiler. For example, other panes and
            views generally react to the selected time in System Profiler to populate their data.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The timeline is laid out vertically as a sequence of timeline drawers. Each drawer corresponds to details about the log file,
            laid out horizontally along a time axis. There are two types of timeline drawers: processes and threads. Threads are grouped
            under their parent process. For each process or thread, its name is displayed along with a line that follows the time axis.
            The line is populated with markings for each event that occurred for the thread, and colored areas to indicate which state
            the thread was in during a given point in time. The following image shows an example of a thread shown on the timeline. 
         </p>

         </div>
         
         
         <p>You zoom the timeline using the toolbar menu actions or key shortcuts. The timeline range, shown at the top of the timeline,
            displays which portion of the log file is currently displayed, relative to the full log file.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The scrollbar that appears above the shaded area allows you to quickly modify which portion of the trace is being displayed.
            By dragging the scrollbar left or right, the shaded area is updated, along with the end points in the header of the Processes
            and Threads section. The Processes and Threads section updates once you release the scrollbar.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>In addition, the Timeline is annotated with details such as Event Labels (described below) and lines indicating IPC activity
            between different threads.

         <p>You can configure the timeline information that's shown in the search result view to show only the interesting trace event
            fields. The content of this table can be cut and pasted to the system clipboard as CSV-formatted data.

            <strong>Event labels</strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Timeline event labels let distinguish between different types of events (the label only shows the data for the event and its
            type). In addition, you can also set the Timeline view to display address translation information, such as function name.
            By using event labels, you can quickly differentiate between different types of events, or display multiple data values for
            the same event. The purpose of event labels is to annotate function entry and exit events in the Timeline pane with their
            corresponding function names. 
         </p>

         <p>The data selection list lets you select multiple data keys. In addition, the dialog lets you define whether you want to customize
            the display pattern for the corresponding label. By default, a default display pattern is provided and consists of the event
            type label, followed by a comma separated list of data keys. The display pattern supports the following replacement patterns:
         </p>
         
         <br clear="none" /><ul>
            <li>Data keys are specified by using <samp class="codeph">$data_key_name$</samp>, and in the Timeline view, they're replaced by the actual value in the event for the given data key. 
            </li>
            <li>To allow labels to span multiple lines, use the <span class="option">\n</span> option. 
            </li>

         <p>In the System Profiler editor's Timeline view, you can navigate to the next or previous event for a specific event owner only.
            This lets you follow a sequence of events generated by a particular set of event owners (for example finding the next event
            owned by a thread, or the messages generated by a client and server).
         </p>
         
         
         <p>In locations where single events have been identified (for example, the Trace Log view, Search Results view), you can navigate
            directly to the event location in the System Profiler Timeline editor pane by double-clicking. The selection marker is moved
            to the event location and, if possible, the specific event owner is scrolled into view in the Timeline editor pane.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The Navigate menu contains a <span class="uicontrol">Go To Event</span> command that lets you jump directly to a specific event. This command allows developers to collaborate more easily with one
            another by providing direct event navigation by event index, event cycle, or natural time.
