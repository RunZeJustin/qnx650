         <p>Neutrino supports a wide variety of CPUs and hardware configurations. Some boards require
            more effort than others to embed the OS. For example, x86-based machines usually have a BIOS,
            which greatly simplifies your job, while other platforms require that you create a complete
            IPL. Embedded systems can range from a tiny memory-constrained handheld computer that boots
            from flash, to an industrial robot that boots through a network, to a multicore system with
            lots of memory that boots from a hard disk. 
            
            
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Whatever your particular platform or configuration, the QNX System Builder helps simplify the
            process of building images and transferring them from your host to your target. 
         </p>
         
         
         <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> For a complete description of OS and flash images, see the <a href="../../com.qnx.doc.neutrino_building/about.html" shape="rect"> Building

         <p>The goal of the boot process is to get the system into a state that lets your program run.
            Initially, the system might not recognize disks, memory, or other hardware, so each section of
            code needs to perform whatever setup is needed in order to run the subsequent section: 
         </p>
         
         <br clear="none" /><ol>
            <li>The IPL initializes the hardware, makes the OS image accessible, and then jumps into it.
               
               
            </li>
            <li>The startup code performs further initializations, and then loads and transfers control to
               the microkernel/process manager (<span class="cmdname">procnto</span>), the core runtime component of the QNX
               Neutrino OS. 
               
               
            </li>
            <li>The <span class="cmdname">procnto</span> module then runs the boot script, which performs any final setup
               required and runs your programs. 
            </li>

            <p>Typical boot order.</p>
            
            
         </div>
         
         
         <p>At reset, a typical processor has only a minimal configuration that lets code be executed
            from a known linearly addressable device (e.g. flash, ROM). When your system first powers on,
            it automatically runs the IPL code at a specific address called the <dfn class="term">reset vector</dfn>. 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong>IPL</strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>When the IPL loads, the system memory usually isn't fully accessible. It's up to the IPL to
            configure the memory controller, but the method depends on the hardware â€” some
            boards need more initialization than others. 
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>When the memory is accessible, the IPL scans the flash memory for the image filesystem, which
            contains the startup code (described in the next section). The IPL loads the startup header
            and startup code into RAM, and then jumps to the startup code. 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The IPL is usually board-specific (it contains some assembly code) and is as small as
            possible. 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong>Startup</strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The startup code initializes the hardware by setting up interrupt controllers, cache
            controllers, and base timers. The code detects system resources such as the processor(s), and
            puts information about these resources into a centrally accessible area called the
            <dfn class="term">system page</dfn>. The code can also copy and decompress the image filesystem
            components, if necessary. Finally, the startup code passes control, in virtual memory mode, to
            the <span class="cmdname">proncto</span> module. 
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The startup code is board-specific and is generally much larger than the IPL. Although a
            larger <span class="cmdname">proncto</span> module could do the setup, we separate the startup code so that
            <span class="cmdname">proncto</span> can be board-independent. Once the startup code sets up the hardware, the
            system can reuse a part of the memory used by startup because the code won't be needed again. 
         </p>
         
         
         <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> If you're creating your own startup variant, its name must start with <tt>startup</tt> or
            the QNX System Builder perspective won't recognize it.

            <strong>The <span class="cmdname">proncto</span> module</strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The <span class="cmdname">proncto</span> module is the core runtime component of the QNX Neutrino OS. It consists
            of the microkernel, the process manager, and some initialization code that sets up the
            microkernel and creates the process-manager threads. The <span class="cmdname">proncto</span> module is a required
            component of all bootable images. 
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The process manager handles (among other things) processes, memory, and the image filesystem.
            The process manager lets other processes see the image filesystem's contents. Once the
            <span class="cmdname">proncto</span> module is running, the operating system is essentially up and running. One
            of the process manager's threads runs the boot script. 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Several variants of <span class="cmdname">proncto</span> are available (e.g. <tt>procnto-400</tt> for PowerPC 400
            series, <tt>procnto-smp</tt> for x86 multicore machines, etc.). 
            
         </p>
         
         
         <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> If you're creating your own <span class="cmdname">proncto</span> variant, its name must start with

         <p> If you want your system to load any drivers or to run
            your program automatically after powering up, you should run those utilities and programs from
            the boot script. For example, you might have the boot script: 
         </p>
         
         <br clear="none" /><ul>
            <li>run a <a href="../../com.qnx.doc.neutrino_utilities/utils-d.html" shape="rect">
                  <tt>devf</tt>
                  </a> driver to access a flash filesystem image, and then run your program from that flash
               filesystem 
            </li>
            <li>create adaptive partitions, run programs in them, and set their parameters:

         </ul>
         
         
         <p>When you build your image, the boot script is converted from text to a tokenized form and
            saved as <span class="filepath">/proc/boot/.script</span>. The process manager runs this tokenized
            script.
