      <h1 class="topictitle1">Types of code coverage in the IDE</h1>
      
      
      
      <div>
         <p></p>
         
         
         <p>Several types of metrics are commonly used in commercial code-coverage tools, ranging
            from simple line or block coverage (i.e. this statement was executed) to
            condition-decision coverage (i.e. all terms in this Boolean expression are exercised). A
            given tool usually provides a combination of types. 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            The coverage tool in the IDE is a visual front end to the
            <tt>gcov</tt> metrics produced by the <span class="cmdname">gcc</span> compiler. These coverage metrics
            are essentially basic <dfn class="term">block coverage</dfn> and <dfn class="term">branch coverage</dfn>.
            
            
            
            
            
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The IDE presents these metrics as line coverage, showing which lines are fully covered,
            partially covered, and not covered at all. The IDE also presents percentages of coverage
            in terms of the actual code covered (i.e. not just lines). 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong>Block coverage</strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Block coverage, sometimes known as line coverage, describes whether a block of code,
            defined as not having any branch point within (i.e. the path of execution enters from
            the beginning and exits at the end) is executed or not. 
            
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>By tracking the number of times the block of code has been executed, the IDE can
            determine the total coverage of a particular file or function. The tool also uses this
            information to show line coverage by analyzing the blocks on each line and determining
            the level of coverage of each.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong>Branch coverage</strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Branch coverage can track the path of execution taken between blocks of code. Although
            this metric is produced by the <span class="cmdname">gcc</span> compiler, currently the IDE doesn't provide
            this information.
