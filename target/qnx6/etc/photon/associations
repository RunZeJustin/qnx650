# Photon Application Associations File
# Describes associations between file content types and applications.
# Currently this file format specifies 8 colon-separated fields.  Unspecified fields may be left
# empty, or the line may be prematurely terminated if no other fields need to be specified for a
# given association.

# Field 1 - file patterns
#    file patterns matching the association (comma-separated list of standard
#    file-matching expressions)
# Field 2 - MIME type (RFC2045/6)
#    MIME type/subtype matching the association
# Field 3 - name of association
#    brief ASCII text string describing the association
# Field 4 - open action
#    command to invoke to "open" (ie "execute") content matching the association
#    this is generally interpreted as the default action to perform on an item.  If
#    other actions are not specified they will default to the "open" action.
#    Special characters:
#        '@' will be substituted for the filename to open
# Field 5 - view action
#    command to invoke to view the content.  If not specified the lib will fallback to "open"
# Field 6 - edit action
#    command to invoke to modify the content.  If not specified the lib will fallback to "open"
# Field 7 - small icon
#    full path to a small (max 24X18) icon representing this association
# Field 8 - large icon
#    full path to a large (max 48X48) icon representing this association
