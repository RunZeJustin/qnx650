         <div class="p">The IDE includes the following updates for this release: <br clear="none" /><ul>
               <li>
                  <strong>Application Profiler:</strong>
                  <br clear="none" /><ul>
                     <li>The cheat sheet for the Application Profiler example was renamed from <span class="q">"QNX Example Application Profiling Project"</span> to <span class="q">"Call Count and Sampling Profiling"</span>, and a few other updates were made to the instructions to reflect changes made to the user interface. 
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  
               </li>
               <li>The <span class="uicontrol">Time</span> column was renamed to <span class="uicontrol">Deep Time</span> and the <span class="uicontrol">Own Time</span> column was renamed to <span class="uicontrol">Shallow Time</span> (see <a href="profiler_Interpret_Tree_Mode.html" shape="rect">Interpreting Tree mode column information by profiling type</a>. 
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Code Coverage:</strong>
                  <br clear="none" /><ul>
                     <li>Information was added to describe how to instrument a static library with code coverage enabled; you either have to instrument
                        your binary with code coverage, or link with the code coverage library using the <span class="option">-lgcov</span> option (see <a href="coverage_How_Coverage_Works.html" shape="rect">How the coverage tool works</a>). 
                        
                     </li>
                     <li>Many Code Coverage topics were changed with updated feature information (see <a href="coverage_Base_.html" shape="rect">Using Code Coverage</a>. 
                     </li>
                     <li>In the section <span class="q">"There are multiple ways to import a file"</span> in the topic <a href="coverage_IMPGCCCODE_.html" shape="rect">Importing gcc code coverage data from a project</a>, references to <span class="filepath">.da</span> were updated to <span class="filepath">.gcda</span> to reflect the <span class="cmdname">gcc</span> files that the IDE currently supports. 
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Debugging:</strong>
                  <br clear="none" /><ul>
                     <li>By default, <span class="cmdname">pdebug</span> now sets <var class="varname">LD_BIND_NOW</var> to 1 to force the loading of all lazy-load dependencies. You can prevent <span class="cmdname">pdebug</span> from setting <span class="envar">LD_BIND_NOW</span> by specifying the new <span class="option">-l</span> (<span class="q">"el"</span>) option. For more information about lazy binding, see the <a href="../../com.qnx.doc.neutrino_prog/devel.html" shape="rect">../../com.qnx.doc.neutrino_prog/devel.html</a> chapter in the Neutrino <cite>Programmer's Guide</cite>.
                     </li>
                     <li>Updates were made to the JTAG Abatron architecture images and corresponding documentation for hardware and software configuration
                        (see <a href="debug_JTAGDebugging_.html" shape="rect">Using JTAG debugging</a>, <a href="debug_JTAGAbtronConnectToHost_.html" shape="rect">Connecting the Abatron BDI2000 JTAG Debugger to your host</a>, <a href="debug_JTAGAbtronConnectToTarget_.html" shape="rect">Connecting the Abatron BDI2000 Debugger to your target</a>, and <a href="debug_JTAGAbtronBuildImage_.html" shape="rect">Building a system image</a> in the IDE <cite>User's Guide</cite>.

                  <strong>Memory Analysis:</strong>
                  <br clear="none" /><ul>
                     <li>For the <em>mallopt()</em> function, we've renamed <tt>MALLOC_FILLAREA</tt> to <tt>MALLOC_CKBOUNDS</tt>, and we've added more information about the <tt>MALLOC_CKALLOC</tt>, <tt>MALLOC_DUMP_LEAKS</tt>, <tt>MALLOC_EVENTBTDEPTH</tt>, <tt>MALLOC_FREE_CHECK</tt>, <tt>MALLOC_START_TRACING</tt>, <tt>MALLOC_STATS</tt>, <tt>MALLOC_TRACEBTDEPTH</tt>, <tt>MALLOC_TRACEMAX</tt>, <tt>MALLOC_TRACEMIN</tt>, <tt>MALLOC_TRACING</tt>, and <tt>MALLOC_VERIFY_ON</tt> options (see <a href="../../com.qnx.doc.neutrino_lib_ref/m/mallopt.html" shape="rect">
                           <tt>mallopt</tt>
                           </a> in the Neutrino <cite>Library Reference</cite>). 
                     </li>
                     <li>The <a href="memory_Memory_Events_View.html" shape="rect">Memory Events</a>, Memory, <a href="memory_Memory_Backtrace.html" shape="rect">Memory Backtrace</a>, and <a href="memory_Memory_Problems_View.html" shape="rect">Memory Problems</a> views are now independent views that aren't included in the Sessions view. 
                     </li>
                     <li>The Trace Details and Statistics views have been removed. The functionality that these views provided is now available by
                        using the filters on the <a href="memory_Memory_Events_View.html" shape="rect">Memory Events</a> view (to obtain the same data). 
                     </li>
                     <li>Although you can continue to use <span class="filepath">libmalloc_g.so</span>, use <span class="filepath">librcheck.so</span> to obtain memory statistics.
                     </li>
                     <li>More information was added to the documentation about timelines (see <a href="sysprof_SysProf_TimelineView_.html" shape="rect">Timeline view</a> in the IDE <cite>User's Guide</cite>). 
                     </li>
                     <li>The cheat sheet for Memory Analysis was renamed to <span class="q">"Memory Analysis Tooling"</span>, and the cheat sheet instructions were updated to reflect the changes made to the user interface. 
                     </li>
                     <li>In the documentation for the IDE <cite>User's Guide</cite>, the Finding Memory Errors chapter was renamed to <span class="q">"Analyzing Memory Usage and Finding Memory Errors."</span> In addition, the topics in this chapter were reordered and modified for technical accuracy; many of the topic titles were
                        renamed as well. 
                        
                     </li>
                     <li>Now, the Memory Analysis Tooling views support grouping and search (see <a href="memory_Memory_Problems_View.html" shape="rect">Memory Problems view</a> and <a href="memory_Memory_Events_View.html" shape="rect">Memory Events view</a>), column preferences (see <a href="memory_Memory_Problems_Preferences.html" shape="rect">Memory Problems Preferences</a> and <a href="memory_Memory_Event_Preferences.html" shape="rect">Memory Events Preferences</a>), and filtering (see <a href="memory_Memory_Problems_Filter.html" shape="rect">Memory Problems Filter</a> and <a href="memory_Memory_Event_Filter.html" shape="rect">Memory Events Filter</a>). 
                     </li>
                     <li>The instructions to import memory analysis data were improved (see <a href="memory_ImpMemanalysisdata_.html" shape="rect">Importing memory analysis data</a> and <a href="memory_File_trace_.html" shape="rect">Performing a postmortem memory analysis</a>). 
                     </li>
                     <li>You can now configure memory analysis settings for a running program from the <a href="memory_Settings_Tab_Options.html" shape="rect">Settings</a> tab (available from the <a href="memory_Memory_Analysis_Editor_Group.html" shape="rect">Memory Analysis editor</a>). 
                     </li>
                     <li>The documented steps to attach to a running process in order to analyze memory events and traces for a running process were
                        updated (see <a href="memory_attach_debug_malloc_.html" shape="rect">Attaching to a running process</a>. 
                     </li>
                     <li>We've added a warning in the documentation regarding the use of Mudflap together with Memory Analysis. If your binary is instrumented
                        with Mudflap, you can't run Memory Analysis on it because there'll be a conflict (trying to overload the same functions),
                        and it will cause the program to crash (see <a href="debug_UsingMudflapInIDE_.html" shape="rect">Using Mudflap</a>). 
                     </li>
                  </ul>

                  <strong>Migration:</strong>
                  <br clear="none" /><ul>
                     <li>We've updated our platform support for this release. For a target OS, the IDE is compatible with targets that run QNX Neutrino.
                        For a host OS, you can now use the IDE with any of the following development hosts (we don't include the IDE on self-hosted
                        QNX Neutrino systems): <br clear="none" /><ul>
                           <li>Microsoft Windows 7 Professional 32- and 64-bit, Vista Business 32- and 64-bit, XP Professional SP3, or 2000 SP4</li>
                           <li>Linux Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.4 Desktop 32- and 64-bit, Red Hat Fedora 12, Ubuntu Workstation 9.10 32- and 64-bit, or openSUSE
                              11.2
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>You can also use the QNX Neutrino RTOS as a virtual machine on VMware Workstation 6.5 or 7.0, VMware Player 3.0, and Microsoft
                           VirtualPC 2007. We provide a VMware image of a runtime installation of QNX Neutrino. If you intend to use the IDE on VMware,
                           to ensure that VMware is supported for your host, search the compatibility guide located at <a href="http://www.vmware.com/resources/compatibility/search.php" target="_blank" shape="rect">

                     </li>
                     <li>A new topic called <a href="migrate_Binary_Compatibility.html" shape="rect">Binary compatibility</a> was created in the chapter Migrating from Earlier Releases to contain a summary of all binary compatibility issues.

                     <li>The QNX Momentics Tool Suite lets you install and work with multiple versions of Neutrino (from 6.2.1 and later). Whether
                        you're using the command line or the IDE, you can choose which version of the OS to build programs for. As a result, various
                        migration topics in the documentation were also updated to help you with your migration tasks. 
                        <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Only versions of Momentics with different medial version numbers can coexist. For example, 6.3.2 can coexist with 6.2.1,
                           but not with 6.3.0. However, 6.4.0 can coexist with 6.4.1 and 6.5.0. Coexistence with 6.2.1 is supported only on Windows hosts.
                           For more information about migration and coexistence, see <a href="migrate_Base_.html" shape="rect">Migrating from Earlier Releases</a> .

                     <li>Previously, if you start the IDE, it uses your current <span class="cmdname">qconfig</span> choice as the default version of the OS. Now, the IDE uses the last installed version of the QNX software that appears in
                        the <span class="uicontrol">Select Install</span> list on the Global QNX Preferences page. For more information about coexistence and setting this option, see <a href="migrate_issues_640_migandco_.html" shape="rect">Coexistence</a>.

                        updated to include instructions about how to create an EFS project. You'll need to follow the workaround instructions found

                        When you profile an application with function instrumentation, the profiler records function enter and function exit events,
                        and uses events to determine the stack at any point in a program. For more information about this feature, see <a href="sysprof_Thread_Call_Stack_View.html" shape="rect">Thread Call Stack view</a>.
