         <p>The OS image is a bootable image filesystem that contains the startup header, startup
            code, <span class="cmdname">proncto</span>, your boot script, and any drivers needed to minimally configure
            the operating system: 
            
            
         </p>

            <span><img src="../images/p2Ftopic2Fbuilder_OS_IFS_File.xml_d11305e31.jpg" alt="Introduction: QNX System Builder; .ifs structure" /></span>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Generally, we recommend that you keep your OS image as small as possible to realize the
            following benefits: 
         </p>
         
         <br clear="none" /><ul>
            <li>Memory conservation — When the system boots, the entire OS image gets
               loaded into RAM. This image isn't unloaded from RAM, so extra programs and data
               built into the image require more memory than if your system loaded and unloaded
               them dynamically. 
            </li>
            <li>Faster boot time — Loading a large OS image into RAM can take longer to
               boot the system, especially if the image must be loaded via a network or serial
               connection. 
            </li>
            <li>Stability — Having a small OS image provides a more stable boot process.
               The fewer components you have in your OS image, the lower the probability that it
               fails to boot. The components that must go in your image (startup, <span class="cmdname">proncto</span>,
               a flash driver or network components, and a few shared objects) change rarely, so
               they're less subject to errors introduced during the development and maintenance
               cycles.
            </li>
         </ul>
         
         
         <p>If your embedded system has a hard drive or CompactFlash (which behaves like an IDE hard
            drive), you can access the data on it by including a block-oriented filesystem driver
            (e.g. <tt>devb-eide</tt>) in your OS image filesystem and calling the driver from your
            boot script. For details on the driver, see <a href="../../com.qnx.doc.neutrino_utilities/d/devb-eide.html" shape="rect">
               <tt>devb-eide</tt>
               </a> in the <cite>Utilities Reference</cite>. 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>If your system has an onboard flash device, you can use it to store your OS image and
            even boot the system directly from flash (if your board allows this — check
            your hardware documentation). Note that an OS image is read-only; if you want to use the
            flash for read/write storage, you'll need to import create a flash filesystem image
            (<span class="filepath">.efs</span> file).
