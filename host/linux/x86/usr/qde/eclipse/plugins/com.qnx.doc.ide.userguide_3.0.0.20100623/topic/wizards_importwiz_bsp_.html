         <p>Although a BSP is, in fact, a package that contains source code, the two types are structured differently and generate different
            types of projects. If you try to import a BSP archive as a QNX Source Package, the IDE won't create a System Builder project.
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Select the method that you want to use to import the package or BSP: from a local file archive, or from a SVN repository on

         <p>Each source package contains several components (or <dfn class="term">projects</dfn>, in IDE terms). For the package you selected, the wizard gives you a list of each source project contained in the archive:

         <p>You can decide to import only certain parts of the source package; simply uncheck the entries you don't want (they're all

            </li>
            <li>Optional: In the <span class="uicontrol">Project Prefix</span> field, type a prefix name that you'd like to use for the project other than the default one specified. This is prepended
               to the name of each project imported from the BSP. 
            </li>
            <li>Optional: If this project is to belong to a working set (meaning that you want to group all related imported projects together

            don't checkout the dependencies for the selected package.

         <p>The IDE sets up the required project properties (compiler options, build targets, and so on) so that the projects are able
            to build after the checkout process. In addition, the IDE maintains the source tree layout (to preserve the current status
            of the checked out source), sets up prebuilt and staging areas for the project, when necessary, and also creates the BSP project.

         <p>When you finish with the wizard, it creates all the projects and brings in the source from the archive. After the checkout
            of the BSP completes, right-click on the BSP project and select <span class="uicontrol">Build</span>; the <span class="filepath">src</span> project will be auto-built by the BSP project. The IDE will build all of the source under one project. Because the IDE creates
            a dependency between the <span class="filepath">BSP</span> project and the <span class="filepath">src</span> project, you don't need to build the <span class="filepath">src</span> project; only the BSP project.

         <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> If you answer <span class="uicontrol">Yes</span>, the IDE begins the build process, which may take several minutes (depending on how much source you've imported).

         <p>If you decide not to build now, you can always do a <span class="uicontrol">Rebuild All</span> from the main toolbar's <span class="uicontrol">Project</span> menu at a later time. 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>If you didn't import all the components from a BSP package, you can bring in the rest of them by selecting the System Builder
            project and opening the import wizard (right-click the project, and then select <span class="uicontrol">Import…</span>). The IDE detects your selection and then extends the existing BSP (rather than making a new one).

         <p>When you import a QNX BSP, the IDE opens the QNX BSP Perspective. This perspective combines the minimum elements from the
