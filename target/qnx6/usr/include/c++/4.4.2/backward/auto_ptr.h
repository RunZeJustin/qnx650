   *  @brief  A simple smart pointer providing strict ownership semantics.
   *
   *  The Standard says:
   *  <pre>
   *  An @c auto_ptr owns the object it holds a pointer to.  Copying
   *  an @c auto_ptr copies the pointer and transfers ownership to the
   *  destination.  If more than one @c auto_ptr owns the same object
   *  at the same time the behavior of the program is undefined.
   *
   *  The uses of @c auto_ptr include providing temporary
   *  exception-safety for dynamically allocated memory, passing
   *  ownership of dynamically allocated memory to a function, and
   *  returning dynamically allocated memory from a function.  @c
   *  auto_ptr does not meet the CopyConstructible and Assignable
   *  requirements for Standard Library <a
   *  href="tables.html#65">container</a> elements and thus
   *  instantiating a Standard Library container with an @c auto_ptr
   *  results in undefined behavior.
   *  </pre>
   *  Quoted from [20.4.5]/3.
   *
   *  Good examples of what can and cannot be done with auto_ptr can
   *  be found in the libstdc++ testsuite.
