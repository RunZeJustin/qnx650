         <p>There are many cases where high CPU load is traced back to server activity. However, in
            most cases what is required to reduce this CPU load isn't to make the servers more
            efficient, but to look more closely at the client activity that is causing the servers
            to run.

         <p>In addition to the Neutrino RUNNING thread state, the log must contain the communication
            events SEND/RECEIVE/REPLY|ERROR. These communication events are used to establish the
            relationship between clients and servers.

         <p>
            <strong>Procedure</strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>QNX Neutrino systems rely heavily on client/server communications most often performed
            via message passing. In these systems, clients send requests to servers asking them to
            do work on their behalf such as shown: 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <span><img src="../images/prof_Isolating_client_load_.xml_d177263e43.jpg" alt="System Profiler: servers and clients" /></span>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Here, A's real CPU usage would be considered to be 2 units of time, B's as 10, and C's as
            2 units of time. Since B and C are both acting as servers, they really execute only when
            there are clients generating requests for action. Most standard CPU Usage metrics don't
            take this type of on behalf of work into consideration. However, if the goal of a kernel
            log file investigation is to locate the source or sources of CPU load, then this type of
            metric is invaluable in assigning blame for high CPU usage. 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The System Profiler provides the Client/Server CPU Statistics view to help extract this
            type of on behalf of metric. You can activate this view via the <span class="menucascade">
               <span class="uicontrol">Window</span>
               &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Show View</span>
               &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Otherâ€¦</span>
               &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Client/Server CPU Statistics</span>
               </span>. 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Once activated, the Client/Server CPU Statistics are gathered on demand, by default,
            targeting the full range of the target log file: 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <span><img src="../images/prof_Isolating_client_load_.xml_d177263e76.jpg" alt="System Profiler: Gather statistics" /></span>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The default display of this view shows the simplified view that displays the RUNNING time
            (slightly different from the CPU Usage in that it doesn't remove the time spent
            interrupted by interrupt handlers) that CPU consumers are consuming directly,
            indirectly, and summed together as a total: 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <span><img src="../images/prof_Isolating_client_load_.xml_d177263e89.jpg" alt="System Profiler: RUNNING time" /></span>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>In this case, it's clear that while the <cite>qconn- Thread 1</cite> isn't consuming much
            CPU on its own, it's imposing a significant amount of time on the system indirectly. If
            you compare this data to what the CPU Usage editor pane displays, you'll see the
            difference in what's reported: 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <span><img src="../images/prof_Isolating_client_load_.xml_d177263e104.jpg" alt="System Profiler: qconn Thread 1" /></span>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>In the CPU Usage table, <cite>procnto- Thread 8</cite> ranks ahead of <cite>qconn- Thread
               1</cite> in its usage. However, <span class="cmdname">proncto</span> is a pure server process, so we
            know that it consumes no CPU resources without being solicited to do so. We suspect that
            perhaps <cite>qconn- Thread 1</cite> is driving <cite>procnto- Thread 1</cite>. 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>We can confirm this suspicion by looking at which servers <cite>qconn- Thread 1</cite> is
            imposing CPU usage on. You can configure the Client/Server CPU Usage view to display all
            of the CPU consumers that are being imposed on (and by whom) by selecting <span class="uicontrol">Show all times</span> from the view's dropdown menu: 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <span><img src="../images/prof_Isolating_client_load_.xml_d177263e141.jpg" alt="System Profiler: Show all times" /></span>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The Client/Server CPU Usage view table changes to show all of the imposed-on servers that
            clients are communicating with. The servers are listed in the columns and the clients in
            the Owner column. Note that this may result in a table with many columns (imposed on
            servers): 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <span><img src="../images/prof_Isolating_client_load_.xml_d177263e153.jpg" alt="System Profiler: imposed-on servers" /></span>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Here we can see that in fact nearly all of the time that <cite>procnto- Thread 8</cite>
            is spending consuming CPU is due to requests coming from <cite>qconn- Thread 1</cite>,
            with only a minimal amount being imposed on it by another <span class="cmdname">qconn</span> thread, <cite>qconn- Thread 6</cite>. 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>This is to be expected, since in order to query the system, the <span class="cmdname">qconn</span> process
            must communicate with the kernel to extract the system state and all the process and
            thread information.
