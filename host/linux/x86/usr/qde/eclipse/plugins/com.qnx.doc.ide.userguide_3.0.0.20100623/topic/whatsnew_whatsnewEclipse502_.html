         <p>The highlights of the new features to Eclipse are:</p>
         
         <br clear="none" /><ul>
            <li>Platform Changes <br clear="none" /><ul>
                  <li>New update UI — The UI for performing installation and updates is
                     completely new in 3.4. You can access the new UI by selecting <span class="menucascade">
                        <span class="uicontrol">Help</span>
                        &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Software Updates</span>
                        </span>. 
                  </li>
                  <li>Unlike previous versions, you no longer have to find and select all
                     prerequisites of the software you're trying to install. You can select only
                     the single component of software you want, and all prerequisites are then
                     automatically determined and installed for you. The Installed Software tab
                     only shows the exact software items that you chose to install, rather than
                     listing everything that's currently installed on your system. When you
                     update software, all prerequisites of the software being updated are also
                     updated, as required. 
                  </li>
                  <li>The new update dialog (<span class="menucascade">
                        <span class="uicontrol">Help</span>
                        &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Software Updates</span>
                        &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Available Software</span>
                        </span>) also lets you add update sites using drag and drop. To make
                     an update site available in Eclipse, you can drag and drop a site URL link
                     from supported browsers into the page. 
                  </li>
                  <li>You can now view the software that's available for install or update in
                     multiple ways. The Available Software tab (<span class="menucascade">
                        <span class="uicontrol">Help</span>
                        &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Software Updates</span>
                        &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Available Software</span>
                        </span>) provides a <span class="uicontrol">View</span> menu button that lets
                     you view the software by site, category, or by name. 
                  </li>
                  <li>Checkbox options (<span class="uicontrol">Show only the latest versions of available
                        software</span> and <span class="uicontrol">Include items that have already been
                        installed</span>) at the bottom of the Available Software dialog
                     let you further control what's displayed in the view. 
                  </li>
                  <li>A new Markers view (<span class="menucascade">
                        <span class="uicontrol">Window</span>
                        &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Show View</span>
                        &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Other</span>
                        &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Markers</span>
                        </span>) was added to incorporate your problems, bookmarks, and tasks
                     into a single view. 
                  </li>
                  <li>The Problems view, Bookmarks view, and Tasks view now have a new look that
                     include the following features: <br clear="none" /><ul>
                        <li>Predefined filters for all errors and warnings on selection </li>
                        <li>Union or intersection of problems showing </li>
                        <li>A forms-based configuration dialog </li>
                        <li>Use of the commands defined in the workbench rather than custom
                           actions, which results in consistency with key bindings and the main
                           window menu 
                        </li>
                        <li>Working sets are now first class selection sources (i.e. if the
                           Package Explorer view shows working sets and the Problems view is
                           filtering on the selection, you'll only see the problems in that
                           working set) 
                        </li>
                        <li>Show multiple content sets. The Problems view lets you see all
                           markers, or just the problems. 
                        </li>
                     </ul>
                     
                     
                  </li>
                  <li>The System Proxy Settings preference page (<span class="menucascade">
                        <span class="uicontrol">General</span>
                        &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Network Connections</span>
                        </span>) lets you specify the proxy settings to use when connecting
                     to the network. The new System proxy configuration option lets you reuse OS
                     proxy settings. Eclipse supports proxy manual settings and automatic
                     configuration for Windows, and proxy environment variables and Gnome
                     settings for Linux. 
                  </li>
                  <li>Eclipse for 64-bit Windows (Windows x86_64/AMD64 and IA64) are now included
                     in Eclipse platforms and SWT downloads. To use them, you must run on a
                     64-bit edition of Windows with a 64-bit JRE. 
                     <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The 32-bit versions of
                        SWT and Eclipse can still be used on these configurations with a 32-bit
                        JRE.
                     </div>
                     
                     
                  </li>
                  <li>For source refactoring, the move, delete and rename resource actions now
                     support refactoring; these new actions are available in the Project
                     Explorer. 
                  </li>
                  <li>There is a new dropins folder at the root of the Eclipse platform install
                     that can be used to drop in additional plugins, separate from the base
                     application. This folder supports various layouts of plugins, features, and
                     link files. On each startup, this directory is scanned, and any newly added
                     content is automatically installed, and any removed content is uninstalled
                     from the running application. 
                  </li>
                  <li>The Eclipse SDK now has a simple installer that you can use to install the
                     SDK from <span class="filepath">www.eclipse.org</span> or its mirrors. This feature
                     provides a faster, authenticated download. The installer also supports a
                     shared install so that multiple Eclipse applications on your system share
                     the same data. The installer is available from the Equinox Download Page. 
                  </li>
                  <li>Now, when you install or upgrade using <span class="menucascade">
                        <span class="uicontrol">Help</span>
                        &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Software Updates</span>
                        </span>, the install process examines the signatures of the code
                     being installed, and verifies that you trust the provider of the software.
                     This verification occurs only once during the install process, after all the
                     new software has been downloaded. The dialog lets you view the certificate
                     trust chain, and examine the details of each certificate. 
                  </li>
                  <li>Previously, icons for files were chosen based on the file's name and
                     extension only. Workbench views now show more specific file icons based on
                     the file's content type. The IDE will initially display a generic icon, and
                     then after determining content types in the background, icons will be
                     replaced with more specific ones, if available. To turn off this behavior,
                     select <span class="menucascade">
                        <span class="uicontrol">General</span>
                        &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Appearance</span>
                        &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Label Decorations preference page</span>
                        </span>. 
                  </li>
                  <li>Eclipse 3.4 now allows multiple remote information centers to contribute
                     content to the Help system. You can specify this feature by selecting <span class="menucascade">
                        <span class="uicontrol">Window</span>
                        &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Preferences</span>
                        &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Help</span>
                        &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Content</span>
                        </span>. 
                  </li>
                  <li>The column widths of certain tables and trees can now be changed in a
                     keyboard-accessible way. This appears in the list of plugins or features
                     available from the About dialog, and as a new view menu item in all views
                     displaying markers (Problems, Tasks, Bookmarks, and Markers).

                  <li>The Help view now has a <span class="uicontrol">Print</span> button. 
                  </li>
                  <li>New projects can now be added to working sets during their creation.
                     Currently all major wizards make use of this feature and there is API
                     available for plugin developer. 
                  </li>
                  <li>You can now close view and editor tabs by clicking anywhere on the tab using
                     the middle mouse button. If your mouse doesn't have a middle button, try
                     clicking on the mouse wheel if it has one.

            <li>Search Changes <br clear="none" /><ul>
                  <li>The text search was improved such that regular expressions support for text
                     search was extended. For example, select <span class="menucascade">
                        <span class="uicontrol">Search</span>
                        &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Search</span>
                        </span>, and in the <span class="uicontrol">Containing</span> field, the new
                     pattern \R will match any line delimiter (Windows <span class="option">\r\n</span>, Linux <span class="option">\n</span>). The \R
                     can't be used in character groups (<samp class="codeph">[]</samp>), since the
                     Windows delimiter \r\n consists of two characters. 
                  </li>
                  <li>Several new constructs are available when replacing text in files,
                     including: <br clear="none" /><ul>
                        <li><span class="option">\R</span> inserts the document line delimiter (same as the <tt>Enter</tt>
                           key) 
                        </li>
                        <li><span class="option">\r</span> and <span class="option">\n</span> insert carriage return and newline characters,
                           respectively. Mixing line delimiters inside a document isn't
                           recommended and may lead to problems with external editors.
                           Typically, <span class="option">\R</span> is a better choice. 
                        </li>
                        <li><span class="option">\t</span> inserts a Tab 
                        </li>
                        <li><span class="option">\xhh</span> and <span class="option">\uhhhh</span> to insert the specified character 
                        </li>
                     </ul>
                     
                     
                  </li>
                  <li>In the Search view, the file search results now show line matches below
                     files. 
                  </li>
                  <li> The text search replace dialog was improved such that replacing text
                     matches (<span class="uicontrol">Replace All</span> or <span class="uicontrol">Replace
                        Selected</span> in the context menu of the text search result view)
                     now uses the same dialog as refactorings (it also includes preview and
                     undo). 
                  </li>
               </ul>

            <li>Editor Changes <br clear="none" /><ul>
                  <li>Direct interaction with text hovers doesn't require you to press <tt>F2</tt>
                     to see the full contents of a hover, and to scroll down. Now, you can just
                     move your mouse over hovers that support this functionality and start
                     scrolling. You can configure the behavior of hovers when the mouse is moved
                     by selecting <span class="menucascade">
                        <span class="uicontrol">Window</span>

                        </span>, and then selecting <span class="menucascade">

                  </li>
                  <li>If a location resolves to multiple hyperlinks, text editors now present all
                     available hyperlinks in a dropdown. You can change the behavior for
                     hyperlinks by selecting <span class="menucascade">
                        <span class="uicontrol">Window</span>
                        &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Preferences</span>
                        </span>, and then selecting <span class="menucascade">

                        </span>. 
                  </li>
                  <li>The regular expressions support in the Find/Replace dialog (<tt>CTRL+F</tt>)
                     was extended such that in the <span class="uicontrol">Find</span> field, the new
                     pattern \R matches any line delimiter (Windows \r\n, Linux \n). The \R can't
                     be used in character groups <samp class="codeph">[]</samp>), since the Windows
                     delimiter \r\n consists of two characters. 
                  </li>
                  <li>In the <span class="uicontrol">Replace With</span> field, several new constructs
                     have been added, for example: <br clear="none" /><ul>
                        <li>\R inserts the document line delimiter (same as the <tt>Enter</tt>
                           key) 
                        </li>
                        <li>\r and \n insert carriage return and newline characters,
                           respectively. Mixing line delimiters inside a document isn't
                           recommended and may lead to problems with external editors.
                           Typically, \R is a better choice. 
                        </li>
                        <li>\t inserts a Tab </li>
                        <li>\xhh and \uhhhh to insert the specified character </li>
                     </ul>
                     
                     
                  </li>
                  <li>There's a new regular expression that allows the case of each match to be
                     retained when using Find/Replace. For example, replacing test with Foo in
                     <samp class="codeph">Test test= TEST</samp> results in <samp class="codeph">Foo foo=
                        FOO</samp>. You can use the same patterns when replacing from the
                     Search view. 
                  </li>
               </ul>
               
               
            </li>
            <li>Various printing improvements <br clear="none" /><ul>
                  <li>The printing support for editors has the following improvements: <br clear="none" /><ul>
                        <li>Line numbers are now printed if enabled in the editor </li>
                        <li>Background color is no longer printed </li>
                        <li>Annotations (e.g. error squiggles) are now printed </li>
                        <li>Each page shows the file name in the header </li>
                        <li>Each page shows the current page number in the footer </li>
                        <li>The print job gets a meaningful name </li>
                     </ul>
                     
                     
                  </li>
                  <li>You can click on the ruler to go to the corresponding line, and you can
                     hover anywhere on the ruler to see the line number at that ruler location. 
                  </li>
                  <li>The overview ruler now has its own context menu that lets you open the
                     preferences. If the context menu is opened on an annotation, then it takes
                     you directly to its annotation type on the Annotations preference page. 
                  </li>
                  <li>Text in the editor can now also be selected by using <tt>Shift+Click</tt> in
                     the ruler's line number. 
                  </li>
                  <li>For the annotation text styles, you can now choose from all available styles
                     for drawing an annotation inside the editor. 
                  </li>
               </ul>

            <li>Team/CVS Changes <br clear="none" /><ul>
                  <li>Right-click on a project in the Project Explorer, and when you select <span class="menucascade">
                        <span class="uicontrol">Team</span>
                        &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Share Project</span>
                        </span>, the action now supports multi-select so multiple projects
                     can be shared in a single operation. 
                  </li>
                  <li>The comment area of the CVS Commit Wizard now presents you with suggested
                     corrections for misspelled words. The options are available using quick
                     assist (<tt>CTRL+1</tt>) and are also shown in the context menu. 
                  </li>
                  <li>File changes can now be viewed in the CVS Commit Wizard. You can view the
                     changes for a file by double-clicking on the file in the Changes pane. 
                  </li>
                  <li>Right-click on a project in the Project Explorer, and when you select <span class="menucascade">
                        <span class="uicontrol">Team</span>
                        &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Ignored Resources</span>
                        </span>, the preference page now lets you specify ignore path
                     patterns, as well as file name patterns. 
                  </li>
                  <li>Improvements have been made to the Apply Patch wizard such that the handling
                     of unmatched patch segments has been modified to be more consistent with how
                     the standard patch application works. Segments that don't match at the
                     location indicated in the patch are automatically tested at previous and
                     later locations in the file to see if an exact match for the patch appears
                     elsewhere. Also, if an exact match can't be found, the number of context
                     lines to ignore when searching for a match can be automatically calculated
                     and applied. 
                  </li>
               </ul>
               
               
            </li>
            <li>Import Team Project Set improvements <br clear="none" /><ul>
                  <li>Improvements have been made about how the import of CVS projects occurs when
                     using a Team Project Set. Previously, a repository location was
                     automatically created with the given connection method, and without a user
                     name when CVS projects were imported from a project set. Now, the import
                     process lets you fully configure the repository location, enabling you to
                     specify a user name and change the connection method. For example, a project
                     set file containing <tt>extssh</tt> connections could now be used you can
                     reconfigure the repository location connection method on import to be
                     <tt>pserver</tt>. 
                  </li>
                  <li>The CVS Apply Patch wizard now lets you see and inspect the sections that
                     matched. Previously, only conflicting chunks were visible. 
                  </li>
                  <li>There's a new option in the CVS Share Project dialog that lets you choose to
                     use the project name as the module name, and place it under the selected
                     module. 
                  </li>
                  <li>The Apply Patch wizard counts lines added and removed in the patch. The
                     default mechanism sums all lines starting with + and -. To define custom
                     patterns that you can use to exclude empty lines or comments, select <span class="menucascade">
                        <span class="uicontrol">Window</span>
                        &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Preferences</span>
                        </span>, and then select <span class="menucascade">
                        <span class="uicontrol">General</span>
                        &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Compare/Patch</span>

            <li>Debug Changes <br clear="none" /><ul>
                  <li>You can now import and export launch configurations in the local file
                     system. Select Launch Configurations from the <span class="uicontrol">Run</span> or
                     <span class="uicontrol">Debug</span> category of the Export wizard, and the next
                     page in the wizard lets you select the configurations to export to a
                     location in the local file system. 
                  </li>
                  <li>You can import launch configurations from a directory in the local file
                     system. 
                  </li>
               </ul>
               
               
            </li>
            <li>Default console and file encoding<br clear="none" /><ul>
                  <li>The console encoding used when running or debugging a program automatically
                     matches the encoding of the program being run or debugged. For example, your
                     program's encoding will be used by the console and a corresponding VM
                     argument will be added to the command line (for example,
                     <span class="option">-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8</span>). This makes it simpler to run and debug code
                     displaying console output. 
                  </li>
                  <li>You can now drag text into the Expressions view to create expressions, and
                     you can reorder entries in the Expressions view with drag-and-drop. 
                  </li>
                  <li>You can now remove items from the launch history menus. Use
                     <tt>Control+Shift+Click</tt> to remove an item from a launch history
                     (select the menu item while pressing <tt>CTRL+Shift</tt>). The launch will
                     be removed from your history, but the configuration isn't deleted. 
                  </li>
