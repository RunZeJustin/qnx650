         <p>The Client/Server CPU Statistics view (<span class="menucascade">
               <span class="uicontrol">Window</span>
               &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Show View</span>
               &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Otherâ€¦</span>

               &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Client/Server CPU Statistics</span>
               </span>) tracks the amount of client/server time spent in the RUNNING state. In a
            message-passing system, it may be that a particular thread is consuming a large amount
            of CPU time, but that CPU time is being consumed based on requests from one or more
            clients. In these cases, in order to achieve a higher performance, the client requests
            on the server must be reduced (assuming that the server is identified as a
            bottleneck).
            
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>This panel provides a tabular display of threads that spend time in a RUNNING state
            (slightly different from pure CPU usage) and breaks down the display such that for each
            thread there is a summary of how much time it spent directly in the RUNNING state and
            how much RUNNING time it imposed on other threads in the system and the total of those
            two times.
         </p>

         <div class="fignone">
            
            <p>The System Profiler's Client/Server CPU Statistics view.</p>
            
            
         </div>
         
         
         <p>You can expand the table, via the View menu, to show how much time the client imposed on
            various server threads. The imposed time is cumulative: if client A sends to server B,
            then until B replies to A, any time that B consumes is seen as imposed on time. If
            during that time B sends to server C, then server C is also billed time as imposed on by
            A. The rationale here is that B would not have engaged with server C were it not for the
            initial message from A.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>By sorting by imposed time, it is possible to identify which clients are predominantly
            driving the system and which servers may be bottleneck points.
