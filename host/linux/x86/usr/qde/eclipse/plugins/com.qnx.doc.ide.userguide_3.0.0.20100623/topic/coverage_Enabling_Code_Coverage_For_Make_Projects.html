# CC refers to the program for compiling C programs (the default is 
# qcc. Use 
# CXX as the program for compiling C++ programs. 

# CFLAGS are additional flags to give to the C compiler. Use CFLAGS  
# for the C++ compiler. 

# -c compiles or assemble the source files, but doesn't link, and the 
# -Wc captures the warning messages. The linking stage isn't done. 
# The ultimate output is in the form of an object file for each
# source file. 

# -Wall turns on all optional warnings that are desirable for normal  
# code. -I. adds the current directory to the list of directories to  
# search for header files. Directories named by -I are searched before  
# the standard system include directories. 

# -O0 is an optimization flag that indicates 'Do not optimize.' 

# LDFLAGS are additional flags to give to compilers when they invoke 
# the ld linker. 

# -ftest-coverage -Wc means that Code Coverage is enabled for your  
# project, and the data is used for test coverage analysis. 

# -fprofile-arcs adds code so that program flow arcs are instrumented.  
# During execution, the program records how many times each branch and 
# call is executed and how many times it is taken or returns, and it 
# saves this data to a file with the extension .gcda for each source  
# file.
# 
# For Code Coverage, you'll need the -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage  
# options in both the compile and link lines, as well as the -p option  
# in the link line. -p is used to generate extra code to write profile 
# information for the analysis program. You must use the -p option when 
# compiling source files that you want data about, and you must also  
# use it when linking.
