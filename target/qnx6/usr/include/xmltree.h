/*
 A TreeList is simply a list of Tree entries that will be compared with a node's tree.
 Each entry consists of a Name, and any number of Attributes.
 Create a new list by using XML_TreeListInit, then you can either call a function which will
 fill the TreeList, or fill the TreeList yourself, using XML_TreeListAddName or
 XML_TreeListAddAttribute.
 Clear the TreeList by calling XML_TreeListClear.
 Destroy the TreeList by calling XML_TreeListDestroy.

 Here are a couple of examples of when to use a TreeList:
 Create a new TreeList, and pass it to XML_TreeGetTags to fill the list with the entries
 required to get from a basenode, to the specified node.
 When doing a XML_TreeFindTreeInList, pass a TreeList to search for the tree structure
 you have created.
 Use XML_TreeCompose to fill in the required tree elements specified in the TreeList,
 if they are not already there.

	 Going backward through the 'nodelist', from the last item, to the first item,
	 each node's tree is entirely passed to XML_TreeCompose, to ensure that items
	 in the trees at the beginning of the list overwrite those at the end of the list.
	 Such a combination can be used to merge many trees together to form a complete
	 tree, where the first node in the list is the most detailed information, and the nodes
	 at the end of the tree are more default values that show through if they have not
	 been explicitly overridden.

	 The 'condition_function' should return 0 for each node that is to be prevented from
	 being considered in the merge.
	 The 'condition_function' filter is not performed on the base tree (last in the list) unless
	 the MERGE_FILTER_ORIGINAL flag is set.
	 If 'condition_function' is NULL, all nodes are added to the tree.
	 The 'condition_cbdata' pointer will be passed to the 'condition_function' as a parameter.
	 If any node in the trees pointed to by 'nodelist' contains an attribute showing
	 (xmlremoved="true"), that branch of the tree will be completely removed from the
	 returned tree, before the next tree is overlayed.

	 The list of strings in 'attributes_to_match' are those attributes which matter, when
	 determining whether two nodes are the same.
	 'num_attributes' must be set to the number of entries in the 'attributes_to_match' array.
	 If 'num_attributes' is 0, no attributes will be considered when determining a match.
	 If 'num_attributes' is -1, all attributes will be considered when determining a match.
	 If 'num_attributes' is -3, all attributes will be considered when determining a match, except unsaved attributes.

	 For each NODE_TYPE_ELEMENT node which is added, its 'userdata' is set so that the
	 new node points to the (most recent) node that created the node.
	 Memory will be allocated in this function, so be sure to keep the returned pointer,
	 and use XML_NodeLinkToNode to combine it with an existing tree, or save it directly.

	 If a node being merged has an attribute called xmlmultiple="true",
	 then multiple entries of that type are allowed in the final document. As long as
	 'num_attributes' is -1, or 'attributes_to_match' includes 'xmlmultiple', then the attribute
	 (xmlmultiple) will be removed from the final merged document. And multiple entries
	 will simply be added instead of changed when another layer is merged over the first.
	 Since the attribute must be matched, the old 'xmlmultiple' will be removed, and the
	 new one will be considered a new branch (also see MERGE_KEEP_MULTIPLE).

	 Returns NULL if there are no items in nodelist, or if the tree cannot be created.
