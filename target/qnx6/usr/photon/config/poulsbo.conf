# Hardware-specific configuration options for Poulsbo display controller.
#
# If this file is not specified, the driver will assume the presence of a
# BIOS and attempt to auto-detect the display configuration.
#
# Two displays are supported, with the following configurations:
#
# GF display No.	Hardware Pipe		Supported interface
#  0			 A			 SDVO
#  1			 B			 LVDS
#
# Note: to enable both displays, two "display" sections are required in
# display.conf.  See io-display documentation for details.
#
# Note: if SDVO is not enabled, the LVDS display will be assigned to
# GF display No. 0 (see the "usesdvo" option below).
#
# Hardware planes are assigned to layers as follows:
#
# Hardware Plane	Hardware Pipe		GF Display No.	GF Layer No.
#  A			 A			 0		 0
#  Overlay		 A			 0		 3
#  C			 A			 0		 4
#  B			 B			 1		 0
#
# It is possible to assign the Overlay and/or Plane C to Hardware Pipe B,
# via the overlaypipe and planecpipe options respectively, but this will
# *not* affect how these planes are assigned to GF displays.
#
# In addition to the hardware planes, there is support for virtual layering
# using the graphics accelerator.  Each display supports an additional 2
# layers.  One of the additional layers is suitable for displaying video
# content, in addition to regular graphics content, and the other is suitable
# for displaying video subpicture data.
#
# Note that there are certain restrictions on using virtual layers:
# o The virtual subpicture layer is implicitly disabled if the virtual video
#   layer on that display is disabled.
# o The virtual subpicture layer is implicitly disabled if the virtual video
#   layer on that display is not displaying an NV12 YUV image.
# o The area of the display occupied by the subpicture layer must be a
#   subset of the area occupied by the virtual video layer on that display.
#
# Combining virtual and physical layers, the following layers are available
# to applications:

# H/W Plane	Type		GF Display No.	GF Layer No.	Capabilities
#  A		 Graphics	 0		 0		 RGB
#  A		 Video (virt)	 0		 1		 YUV/RGB
#  A		 Subpic (virt)	 0		 2		 Subpicture
#  Overlay	 Video		 0		 3		 YUV, scaler
#  C		 Video/Graphics	 0		 4		 RGB, YUV
#  B		 Graphics	 1		 0		 RGB
#  B		 Video (virt)	 1		 1		 YUV/RGB, scale
#  B		 Subpic (virt)	 1		 2		 YUV, scale

#### General settings
#
# usesdvo	Set to 1 to enable a display connected via the SDVO
#		interface.  Set to 0 to disable the SDVO display.  If
#		the SDVO display is enabled, the LVDS display is be
#		assigned to GF display No. 1.  Otherwise, the LVDS display
#		will be assigned to GF display No. 0.
# directsdvo Set to 1 to program SDVO directly, not using the bios. By default
#     the driver will use the BIOS to program the SDVO if the BIOS is available.
# uselvds	Set to 1 to enable a display connected via the LVDS interface.
# overlaypipe	Set to 0 to assign overlay to pipe A, or 1 for pipe B.
# planecpipe	Set to 0 to assign Plane C to pipe A, or 1 for pipe B.
# vidbase	Physical address of the video memory aperture.  Normally,
#		"vidbase" and "vidsize" do not need to be specified, since
#		Startup communicates the size and location of a pre-allocated
#		aperture to the driver via the Syspage.  If a video memory
#		aperture has not been pre-allocated, then specify a base
#		of 0xffffffff, which will cause the driver to allocate memory
#		for the graphics aperture.
# vidsize	Specifies the size of the video memory aperture, whether
#		the aperture has been pre-allocated or not.  If not specified,
#		the default aperture size is 64Meg.
# vidbase	Physical address of the video memory aperture.  Normally,
#		"vidbase" and "vidsize" do not need to be specified, since
#		Startup communicates the size and location of the aperture to
#		the driver via the Syspage.
# vidsize	Size of the video memory aperture.  If "vidbase" is
#		not specified, and if the base and size of the aperture
#		were not stored in the Syspage by Startup, then the driver
#		will allocate the video aperture from system memory.  The
#		size of this allocation will default to 64Meg if "vidsize" is
#		not specified.
#
#		Note: the driver assumes that the specified memory aperture
#		is cacheable.  Ideally, the memory would be marked as
#		Write-Combinable via the Memory Type Range Registers (MTRRs).
# sgx_pbsize	Size of the Parameter Buffer used to store the tiled display
#               list, needed for deferred rendering.  Defaults to 8Mb.
#               Depending on the complexity of the scenes been rendered, it
#               may need to be increased to avoid the performance penalty
#               associated with breaking the scene up into multiple passes.

# Crown Beach reference board with startup-bios:
# Allocate 64 Meg aperture, and use "external" display via SDVO
general:uselvds=0,usesdvo=1,overlaypipe=0,planecpipe=0,vidsize=0x04000000

#### Per Display-Pipe settings
#
# pllref	The PLL input reference frequency, in Khz.
#
# dpll		Bits to OR into the DPLL register.  Only the following fields
#		should be set (the driver calculates settings for the rest):
#
#		  SDVO Multiplier
#		  Parallel to Serial Load Pulse phase selection
#		  PLL Reference Input Select
#		  DPLL Mode Select
#		  SyncLock Enable
#		  High Speed IO clock Enable
# dither	Enable dithering (should be set for 18-bit LVDS displays)
# novirtual	Set to 1 to disable virtual layers, if virtual layers
#		(GF layers 1 and 2) will not be used.  Attempts to
#		use layers 1 and 2 will fail.  Disabling virtual layers
#		will save some memory.
		
# SDVO on Pipe A (Pipe A doesn't support LVDS)

# LVDS on Pipe B, 18-bit display
